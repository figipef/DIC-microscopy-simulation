# DIC-microscopy-simulation
A simple program used to simulate how a DIC microscope would visualize an object of different OPL's (Optical path lengths).
## How to use

### 0ยบ
Please install the following python libraries:

numpy;

matplotlib; 

PIL;

You'll need an MTF file, to be read by the leitorfile.py (please use a simple 2 columns approach). If you don't use an MTF, comment the appropriate part of the code out
### 2ยบ
Change pygame event code "press s" If you'de like to see the FT, and FT * MTF, of the OPD image 

--Instructions--
    
"+" - Darken the pencil (Aumentar o OPD)

"-" - Whiten the pencil (Diminuir o OPD)

"t" - Decrease the wave lenght

"y" - Increase the wave length

"u" - Decrease pencil radius

"i" - Increase pencil radius

### 3ยบ
Just run the python code
